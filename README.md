# rDatasets
An R package containing a bunch of real and synthetic data sets formatted as R objects. Also, all data objects expose the data through an unified interface. This approach helps writing code for massive experiments on top of several datasets without relying on specific data sets details, as labels and features columns, for instance.

All data objects names in the package use the convention of ending with a dash (as 'iris_', for example), in order to avoid overriding native data objects in others arbitrary packages.

# _datasets
An R package containing a bunch of real and synthetic data sets formatted as R objects. Also, all data objects expose the data through an unified interface. This approach helps writing code for massive experiments on top of several datasets without relying on specific data sets details, as labels and features columns, for instance.

The dash symbol is used as preffix in the name of the package, because there's already a package called 'datasets' in r base. Moreover, all data objects in the package use this convention, starting with a dash, as '_iris', for example.
